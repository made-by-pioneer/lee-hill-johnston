      <description>Protecting yourself should your vehicle be damaged or stolen is just as important as having insurance for liability. Having auto insurance will insure property damage or injury to others caused by you and other household members as a result of operating a motor vehicle. Other policy features include medical payment reimbursement and reimbursement for injury caused to you by an uninsured or inadequately insured driver.
There are many special situations where you may need to customize your policy; examples include installation of custom audio equipment, business use of your auto, and teenage and guest drivers, to name a few.</description>

      <description>Business property insurance gets your business up and running quickly after a fire, theft, or other misfortune. Repairing your building or replacing inventory, equipment or other business personal property is time-consuming and expensive, but if you exercise the business interruption option, your commercial property insurance can also replace lost income and pay suppliers while your business is being put back together after a covered loss and claim.</description>

      <description>Standard commercial insurance liability limits should be enough to protect your business from most situations where your business is charged with legal liability for injury or property damage. But it won&amp;rsquo;t cover those catastrophic lawsuits and judgements that are increasing in frequency.</description>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/products/personal/umbrella-coverage/</guid>
      <description>Personal umbrella insurance provides extra coverage above the liability coverage in home, auto and other personal insurance policies. Those policies usually carry liability limits of $100,000 or $300,000, but is that enough? Umbrella insurance adds a layer of coverage of $1 million, $2 million or more, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t just for the ultra-wealthy.</description>

      <description>Workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance in Georgia works two ways: it protect your employees and it protects your business. If an employee is injured on the job, work comp insurance will pay for medical care, disability - whether permanent or temporary, and death benefits. If you are found to be liable for employee injury or illness, workers&amp;rsquo; compensation will protect you and your business. This type of insurance is often mandatory.</description>

      <description>Many natural disasters, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, are covered in a homeowner policy. Others, like earthquake and flood are not. Let us know if you have any concerns about your protection from loss due to natural or even man made disasters; we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to review your insurance program and let you know what, if any, changes you might want to consider.</description>

      <title>Do I need a condominium policy if my condominium association has a master policy for the complex?</title>
      <link>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/business-insurance/do-i-need-a-condominium-policy-if-my-condominium-association-has-a-master-policy-for-the-complex/</link>

      <description>The association master policy is for coverage to the structure, which you don&amp;rsquo;t need. However, to get protection for your own possessions and for legal liability related to your own unit, you need your own policy. Many condominium associations will assess unit owners for master policy deductibles. That&amp;rsquo;s another reason why it is important to have your own policy and why it is important that the coverage in your policy match up well with the association master policy.</description>

      <title>Do I need to buy insurance from the rental car company if I have my own personal automobile insurance?</title>
      <link>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/do-i-need-to-buy-insurance-from-the-rental-car-company-if-i-have-my-own-personal-automobile-insurance/</link>

      <description>That depends. Liability protection that you carry for personal injury and property damage will provide some protection while you are driving the rental car. Damage to the rental car would be covered under Collision and Comprehensive Coverage, if your policy has it. The rental car company may also try to recover damages for lost income while the rental car is out of service. Your auto policy may or may not protect you against this claim; the best way to know is to look at your policy or ask us to review it for you.</description>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/does-my-homeowner-policy-cover-my-possessions-when-they-are-not-in-my-house/</guid>
      <description>A standard homeowner policy provides coverage equal to 10% of the limit for Coverage C of a homeowner policy or $1,000, whichever is greater. This coverage is useful for protecting you while traveling and for other temporary situations. If you have property in excess of these amounts away from home or property that is kept away from your residence premises for extended periods, you should consider additional protection.
The 10% limitation for household property, is for property at an Insureds Residence Premise&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;There is no limitation for property carried on vacation or stored in a storage unit.</description>

      <description>Your policy will normally adjust for differences in other state requirements if you have the required minimum coverage for your state. Personal automobile policy protection is only applicable in the United States, US territories and possessions and the provinces of Canada.</description>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/life-insurance/how-often-should-i-review-my-life-insurance-policy/</guid>
      <description>You should review all of your insurance needs at least once a year. If you have a major life change, you should contact your insurance agent or company representative. The change in your life may have a significant impact on your insurance needs. Life changes may include:
 Marriage or divorce
 A child or grandchild who is born or adopted
 Significant changes in your health or that of your spouse/domestic partner</description>

      <title>I&#39;m not near any body of water. Is there any particular reason why I would need flood insurance? Doesn&#39;t my homeowner policy provide flood coverage?</title>

      <description>Homeowner policies specifically exclude reimbursement for damage caused by flood. Your home may be a significant distance from a major body of water but still be exposed to flood risk if your home was built in a flood plain. The National Flood Insurance Program has a flood risk indicator on their website. All you have to do is enter your property address and you will get an indication of the degree of flood risk you face.</description>

      <description>That depends. A business auto policy by itself won&amp;rsquo;t extend protection to rented autos unless you have amended it. You can get protection for situations where you rent autos if you add Hired Auto Liability and Physical Damage coverage.</description>

      <link>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-renters-policy/</link>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-renters-policy/</guid>
      <description>Renters policies provide several benefits. A renters policy will provide compensation for many types of loss to your personal property. Renters policies also include liability protection. This can be especially important because a fire, caused by your negligence, could damage a large number of other rental units and the property contained in them. Liability coverage will normally cover your legal obligations to compensate other parties in cases like this as well as for other instances where you are legally liable for damage of loss.</description>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/what-happens-after-i-file-a-claim/</guid>
      <description>The claim process has a few variations but these are the essential steps once the claim has been submitted to the insurance company:
 You will be contacted by an insurance company adjuster to gather detailed information about your claim.
 Often, someone from the insurance company will inspect your auto or property for damage or will ask you to provide evidence of value and ownership for loss to property that is not a vehicle or real property.</description>

      <description>If you own, lease (long term) or finance your vehicle then you will file a claim with your insurance company. You will have to pay any deductible amount. Payment for your loss will include payment to the finance or leasing company, if any. If you cause damage to other vehicles or property, your insurance company will handle that with little or no involvement on your part, in most cases.</description>

      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/personal-insurance/what-if-another-driver-hits-my-car/</guid>
      <description>In most cases the other driver’s insurance policy would respond and reimburse you for damages to your vehicle, property or injuries. In some cases, as when you or your passengers are injured and the other driver has inadequate or no insurance, coverage from your own policy may apply (Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist Coverage).</description>

      <title>What kind of insurance does my business need?</title>
      <link>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/business-insurance/what-kind-of-insurance-does-my-business-need/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lee-hill-johnston.netlify.com/faqs/business-insurance/what-kind-of-insurance-does-my-business-need/</guid>
      <description>That depends on the kind of business you engage in. All businesses need basic liability to protect them against acts of owners or employees for which the business might be considered legally liable. Professional service providers often need special liability protection. Examples might be professional liability protection for lawyers, doctors, architects or software designers. Another example are businesses that manufacture or distribute a product; they typically need product liability protection. It&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to review the kinds of liability exposures your business might have when updating or initiating an insurance program.</description>

      <description>Generally the answer is no. One claim is not a cause for concern on the part of insurance companies. But a pattern of claims may result in a premium increase or cancellation. So if you have a claim that is the third in three years, for example, that will be viewed differently than having one claim only. Individual claims that are suggestive of gross negligence can also result in significant premium increase or cancellation.</description>

      <description>Your automobile policy protection is extended to anyone you grant permission to drive your car. You do not need to explicitly provide permission, the other person only needs to have a reasonable belief that they are driving with permission.</description>

      <description>Typical policies provide coverage for you and relatives that live with you. So, if your roommate is not a relative you will not be protected under his or her policy. Renters policies are very affordable, starting at not much more than $150 a year and they provide liability protection as well as coverage for your personal possessions.</description>
