      <description>Business property insurance gets your business up and running quickly after a fire, theft, or other misfortune. Repairing your building or replacing inventory, equipment or other business personal property is time-consuming and expensive, but if you exercise the business interruption option, your commercial property insurance can also replace lost income and pay suppliers while your business is being put back together after a covered loss and claim.</description>

      <description>Workers&amp;rsquo; compensation insurance in Georgia works two ways: it protect your employees and it protects your business. If an employee is injured on the job, work comp insurance will pay for medical care, disability - whether permanent or temporary, and death benefits. If you are found to be liable for employee injury or illness, workers&amp;rsquo; compensation will protect you and your business. This type of insurance is often mandatory.</description>
