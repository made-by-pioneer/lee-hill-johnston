The claim process has a few variations but these are the essential steps once the claim has been submitted to the insurance company:

1. You will be contacted by an insurance company adjuster to gather detailed information about your claim. 

2. Often, someone from the insurance company will inspect your auto or property for damage or will ask you to provide evidence of value and ownership for loss to property that is not a vehicle or real property. 

3. An estimate is prepared. 

4. A check is delivered. 

5. Sometimes differences in actual and estimated damages arise, especially after repair work has been undertaken. Every attempt is made to resolve these differences and sometimes a supplemental check is prepared. 

It is the responsibility of the insurance company to settle and pay your claim and the responsibility of our agency to make sure that is done as quickly and fairly as possible with a minimum of uncertainty and bother for you. We monitor claim progress closely and communicate with you throughout to make sure you are satisfied.
