Protecting yourself should your vehicle be damaged or stolen is just as important as having insurance for liability. Having auto insurance will insure property damage or injury to others caused by you and other household members as a result of operating a motor vehicle. Other policy features include medical payment reimbursement and reimbursement for injury caused to you by an uninsured or inadequately insured driver. 

There are many special situations where you may need to customize your policy; examples include installation of custom audio equipment, business use of your auto, and teenage and guest drivers, to name a few.
