Business property insurance gets your business up and running quickly after a fire, theft, or other misfortune. Repairing your building or replacing inventory, equipment or other business personal property is time-consuming and expensive, but if you exercise the business interruption option, your commercial property insurance can also replace lost income and pay suppliers while your business is being put back together after a covered loss and claim.
