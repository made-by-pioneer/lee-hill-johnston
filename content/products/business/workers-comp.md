Workers' compensation insurance in Georgia works two ways: it protect your employees and it protects your business. If an employee is injured on the job, work comp insurance will pay for medical care, disability - whether permanent or temporary, and death benefits. If you are found to be liable for employee injury or illness, workers' compensation will protect you and your business. This type of insurance is often mandatory.
